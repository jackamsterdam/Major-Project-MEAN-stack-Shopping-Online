# Summary of Shopping Online MEAN project by Jack Amsterdam
â€¢	Virtual Supermarket: Using Angular with the MEAN stack, I created a site that allows for registration/login, selection of products by category, add to cart, with option to update and delete cart items, order page, and thank you page with receipt. It includes an admin page and requires users to be authenticated.

**Bonus- take notice of the following features:**

Correct use of Enums to populate select option fields instead of hard coding strings

Reusable Shared components: products component, categories component, cart componennts and just passing Output to parents instead of duplicating components

Use of  custom pipes

Object oriented thinking - using objects made out of classes instead of literal objects

Used examples of both Forms Module as well as Reactive Forms in Angular
