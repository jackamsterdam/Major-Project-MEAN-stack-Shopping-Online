Bonus- take notice of the following features:

Correct use of Enums to populate select option fields instead of hard coding strings

Reusable Shared components: products component, categories component, cart componennts and just passing Output to parents instead of duplicating components

Use of  custom pipes

Object oriented thinking - using objects made out of classes instead of literal objects

Used examples of both Forms Module as well as Reactive Forms in Angular
